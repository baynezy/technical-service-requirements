## Reusability Criteria

### As a Reusable Service, I should:

- Follow open source best practices / ways of working
- Offer visibility into my CI i.e. test feedback
- Offer visibility of issues / backlog
- Offer a way for people to raise issues / features
- Have clear documentation on how to use / consume the service
- Have clear examples on how to use / consume the service
- Be easily accessible
- Architected so upgrades do not cause downtime
- Offer a status page for the service for good communication on issues / downtime
- Be highly available
- Be backwards compatible i.e. an upgrade of one version should not break a dependent service using an older version
- Should have good performance metrics
- Should autoscale based on the performance metrics
- Should follow internal standards and technology stacks
- Libraries should be hosted in an accessible repository
- No interaction with the team should be necessary to consume or reuse the service
